### تلخيص 
who is writer 


Whom Is This Book For? Software is at the core of so many of the tools we use today: nearly everyone uses social networks to communicate, many people have internet-connected computers in their phones, and most office jobs involve interacting with a computer to get work done. As a result, the demand for people who can code has skyrocketed. Countless books, interactive web tutorials, and developer boot camps promise to turn ambitious beginners into software engineers with six-figure salaries. This book is not for those people. It’s for everyone else. On its own, this book won’t turn you into a professional software developer any more than a few guitar lessons will turn you into a rock star. But if you’re an office worker, administrator, academic, or anyone else who uses a computer for work or fun, you will learn the basics of programming so that you can automate simple tasks such as these: • Moving and renaming thousands of files and sorting them into folders • Filling out online forms—no typing required • Downloading files or copying text from a website whenever it updates • Having your computer text you custom notifications • Updating or formatting Excel spreadsheets • Checking your email and sending out prewritten responses These tasks are simple but time-consuming for humans, and they’re often so trivial or specific that there’s no ready-made software to perform them. Armed with a little bit of programming knowledge, however, you can have your computer do these tasks for you. Conventions This book is not designed as a reference manual; it’s a guide for beginners. The coding style sometimes goes against best practices (for example, some programs use global variables), but that’s a trade-off to make the code simpler to learn. This book is made for people to write throwaway code, so there’s not much time spent on style and elegance. Sophisticated programming concepts—like object-oriented programming, list comprehensions, and generators—aren’t covered because of the complexity they



#### What Is Python?
Python is a programming language and  interpreter software that reads source code (written in the Python language . The name Python comes from the surreal British comedy group Monty Python, not from the snake. Python programmers are affectionately called Pythonistas


### Programmers Don’t Need to Know Much Math
The most common anxiety is know math 
most programming doesn’t require math beyond basic arithmetic
محتاج تعرف اساس العادي فقط مش محتاج حاجة كتير 
واعطي مثال sudoku game  مش محتاج تكون عارف كل حاجة علشان تعرف  تحلها


### You Are Not Too Old to Learn Programming
The second most common anxiety I hear about learning to program is that people think they’re too old to learn it
كاتب بيشرح حالتين من الناس من قلق ناس حاسه بيه انه ان تاني حاجة ان ناس فاكرة انها كبرت على تعلم 
بس حقيقة You don’t need to have started as a child to become a capable programmer

programming is much easier to learn today than it was 
كاتب بيوضح انه بيقول تلوقتي بقت اسهل وافضل تقدر تعلم برمجة عن زمان 
وختم هنا بانه بيقول
"everything I learned about programming in the years between grade school and high school graduation could be learned today in about a dozen weekends"
 وحث انه لازم يكون تفكيرك It’s important to have a “growth mindset” about programming

### Programming Is a Creative Activity
هنا الكاتب بيوضحلنا ان البرمجة هي ابتكار زي قطع ليجو هي اداة ونقدر نبتكر من نفسنا ونبني حاجات
والفرق انك في برمجة محتاج كوبيوتر و اي اداة سوفت وير تنزلها وتشتغل عليها مش محتاج كل شوية قطع ليجو او فيلم واي اي حاجة غير كوبيوتر 
وتقدر تنسخ بكفاء برنامج بتاعك وتشاركه كما هو بكل سهولة وختمها ب
